# Data 605 Discussion week10 # 11.2.8

## 8 In Example 11.13 (Drunkard¡¦s Walk) of this section, assume that the probability of a step to the right is 2/3, and a step to the left is 1/3. Find N, Nc, and NR. Compare these with the results of Example 11.15

transition matrix in canonical form:
```{r}
P <- matrix(c(0, 1/3, 0, 0, 0, 2/3, 0, 1/3, 0, 0, 0, 2/3, 0, 0, 0, 1/3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2/3, 0, 1), nrow=5)
P
```

N:

```{r}
library(matlib)
Q <- matrix(c(0, 1/3, 0, 2/3, 0, 1/3, 0, 2/3, 0), nrow=3)
Q
I <- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1), nrow=3)
I
IQ <- I-Q
IQ

N <- inv(IQ)
N
```

NR: 

```{r}
R <- matrix(c(1/3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2/3), nrow=3)
R
NR <-round(N %*% R, 4)
NR
```

NC:

```{r}
c <-matrix(c(1, 1, 1), nrow=3)
NC <- N %*% c
NC
```
