# Discussion 6

# Chapter 3.2 Exercise 20

## 20. A six-card hand is dealt from an ordinary deck of cards. Find the probability that:

### a) All six cards are hearts.

$$\binom{13}{6} / \binom{52}{6}$$
= 1716 / 20358520 
= 0.000084

### b) There are three aces, two kings, and one queen
$$\binom{4}{3}\binom{4}{2}\binom{4}{1} / \binom{52}{6}$$
= 4x6x4 / 20358520
= 0.000047

### c) There are three cards of one suit and three of another suit.

$$\binom{4}{2}  . \left (\binom{13}{3}\binom{13}{3}/ \binom{52}{6} \right )$$
= 6 x ( 286 x 286 / 20358520 )
= 0.0241
