# 1.1 exercise 6

In Las Vegas, a roulette wheel has 38 slots numbered 0, 00, 1, 2, . . . , 36. The
0 and 00 slots are green and half of the remaining 36 slots are red and half
are black. A croupier spins the wheel and throws in an ivory ball. If you bet
1 dollar on red, you win 1 dollar if the ball stops in a red slot and otherwise
you lose 1 dollar. Write a program to find the total winnings for a player who
makes 1000 bets on red.


```{r}
bets <- function(plays){
  dollars <- 0       # start from zero
  
for (i in 1:plays){
  spins <- sample(1:38, 1, replace = TRUE)

  for (count in spins){
    
    if(count <= 18){
    
      dollars[i+1] <- dollars[i] + 1
    } else {
      dollars[i+1] <- dollars[i] - 1
    }
  }
  
}
  return(dollars)
}
# Total wining for 1000 bets

bets(1000)


```
